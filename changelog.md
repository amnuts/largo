## [Largo 0.7.0](https://github.com/INN/largo/compare/v0.6.4...v0.7.0)

### Fixes and minor improvements

- Fixed an issue where the CSS Variables theme option was not working due to improperly escaped regex's in `inc/custom-less-variables.php`. We fixed those expressions and also changed the `put_contents` and `get_contents` functions in the class to be static functions rather than protected. [Pull request #1772](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1772) for [issue #1771](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1771).

## [Largo 0.6.4](https://github.com/INN/largo/compare/v0.6.3...v0.6.4)

### Developer-facing improvements

- Adds `largo_category_after_primary_featured_post` hook between primary and secondary featured posts on the `category.php` template. [Pull request #1703](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1703) by [@megabulk](https://github.com/megabulk).
- Adds `largo_series_before_stories` hook before stories on the `series-landing.php` template. [Pull request #1703](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1703) by [@megabulk](https://github.com/megabulk).
- Adds `largo_archive_before_stories` hook before stories on the `archive.php` template. [Pull request #1703](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1703) by [@megabulk](https://github.com/megabulk).

### Fixes and minor improvements

- Updates `largo_home_single_top` function to get `homepage_feature_term` and `top_story_term` values from slug instead of by name. If these prominence names were updated to anything else, `homepage_feature_term` and `top_story_term` would be false and fallback to `__('Homepage Featured', 'largo')`. [Pull request #1709](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1709) for [issue #1445](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1445).

Also adds a `overflow-wrap: breakword;` style to the search-result URL to make sure it doesn't overflow the result container. [Pull request #1710](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1710) for [issue #1509](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1509).

Also modified Gutenberg block image caption styling to be consistent with the classic image caption styling when the image is expanded into a lightbox. [Pull request #1711](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1711) for [issue #1702](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1702).
- Fixes multiple `Undefined variable: post` errors in `homepage/templates/top-stories.php`. [Pull request #1728](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1728) for [issue #1723](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1723).

## [Largo 0.6.3](https://github.com/INN/largo/compare/v0.6.2...v0.6.3)

### Fixes and minor improvements

- Fixes several issues with magnification behavior of images. [Pull request #1695](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1695) for [issue #1664](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1664)

## [Largo 0.6.2](https://github.com/INN/largo/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2)

This release brings improved compatibility with the WordPress Block Editor. The CSS class names `type-pull-quote`, `type-aside`, `alignleft`, `alignright`, `aligncenter` and `half` provided by Largo's "Module Wrapper" function in the Classic Editor are now supported on blocks via the "Additional CSS Classes" control, enabling improved pull quote display.

This release removes support for Google Plus, which shut down on April 2, 2019.

This release also contains a number of bug fixes and minor updates.

Particular thanks go to outside contributors [@seanchayes](https://github.com/seanchayes) and [@megabulk](https://github.com/megabulk).

### Feature updates

- Adds support for responsive embedded content, which is most noticeable with video content set to full width. [Pull request #1689](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1689) for [issue #1688](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1688).
- Image and embed blocks aligned left/right, on viewports that are too small to display them reasonably in the indicated position, become 100% width of the column and lose their alignment. [Pull request #1630](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1630) by [@seanchayes](https://github.com/seanchayes) for [issue #1611](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1611).
- Matches the default styles for Gutenberg's Pull Quote block with Largo's styles for `<blockquote>`. Adds styles for `<cite>` elements. [Pull Request #1687](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1687) for [issue #1682](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1682).
- Ensures that the CSS classes used by Largo's Classic Editor plugin "Module Wrapper" can be used on pull quotes. [Pull Request #1687](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1687) for [issue #1682](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1682). If you'd like to make use of these classes by adding them to a Pull Quote block in the "Additional CSS Class" control of the "Advanced" section of the pull quote's block settings, the list of classes is as follows:
	- `type-pull-quote`: appears larger in the story, with a slightly fancier presentation
	- `type-aside`: appears smaller, without decoration
	- `alignleft`: block is aligned left. This class may make it impossible to select the block in the editor with your mouse, requiring use of the keyboard to move the cursor into the block.
	- `alignright`: block is aligned right. This class may make it impossible to select the block in the editor with your mouse, requiring use of the keyboard to move the cursor into the block.
	- `aligncenter`: block is aligned center.
	- `half`: Block is half the width of the column at all but the smallest screen widths.
- Removed all Google+ profile fields in the admin interface and buttons on the front-end due to [Google+ being shut down](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723#whatshappening) on April 2, 2019. [Pull request #1667](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1667) for [issue #1546](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1546).
- Prevents search engine indexing on 404 and search results pages. This change is to keep up with SEO best practices, to preserve your crawl budget with Google, and to prevent a SEO hijacking attack whereby spammers search for their URL on your site, then get the resulting search query result page listed in search engines using your site's reputation. [Pull request #1674](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1673) for [issue #1615](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1615).
- Updates INN's logos in the `img/` folder. If your child theme redefines the function `inn_logo()`, please update that function to reference the new SVG image locations in `img/`. [Pull request #1633](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1633) for [issue #1621](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1631)

### Function updates

- Adds the term's taxonomy slug and term slug in the format `taxonomy-term` as a class on the term in the output of `largo_top_term()`, `largo_category_and_tags()`, and `largo_maybe_top_term()`. [Pull request](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1648) for [issue #1646](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1646).

- If Co-Authors Plus is active, and if a post has an `author` term, but the term has no corresponding `guest-author` post, when running `largo_byline()`, the byline will now contain an HTML comment informing why the byline is empty. If the `WP_DEBUG` or `LARGO_DEBUG` constants are true, Largo will add a message to the server's error log of the form "post 123 should have at least one co-author, but has none!" [Pull request #1607](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1607) for [Automattic/Co-Authors-Plus#637](https://github.com/Automattic/Co-Authors-Plus/issues/637) and as part of the general cleanup ticket [#1492](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1492).

### Fixes and minor improvements

- Defines a new image size `96x96` for use on avatars and small square listing images. This is a bug fix; Largo has referred to such an image size for a long time but never made sure that such images existed. Sites worried about this issue may want to regenerate thumbnail images. [Pull request #1672](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1672) for [issue #1619](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1619).

- Prevents `largo_top_term()` from calling `largo_category_and_tags()` when the post ID argument passed to `largo_top_term()` does not match `get_the_ID`'s post ID, because there is presently no way to pass that ID to `largo_category_and_tags()`.

### Upgrade notices

- If your child theme redefines the function `inn_logo()`, please update that function to reference the new INN logo SVG image locations in `img/`.
- If you have a custom `partials/nav-global.php` you may want to copy the `if ( ! is_search() ) { ... }` logic from [pull request #1604](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1604/) to reduce user confusion about which search form to use.
- If your site has replaced or modified Largo's navigation.js, you may want to reassess that in light of the changes made in [#1544](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1544).


## [Largo 0.6.1](https://github.com/INN/largo/compare/v0.6...v0.6.1)

This release contains bug fixes for Largo 0.6.

### Changes

- Uses [`filemtime()`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.filemtime.php) as the version number for more enqueued assets, meaning that cachebusting will be handled by file modification time and not by Largo version.

[PR #1503](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1503/files#diff-751911f6a0ebcc05da47094668329397) for [issue #1404](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1404).
- Alphabetizes the contributor list in `readme.md`.

### Removed
- Deprecates `largo_fb_user_is_followable()`, [because Facebook changed their API](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1503#issuecomment-407869218).
- Removes the default inclusion of Google Analytics with INN's Largo Project IDs. [PR #1502](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1502) as part of [issue #1495](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1495), and by request.
- Removes the INN Member RSS widget, because the RSS feed it draws from is no longer supported or maintained by INN. Because the RSS feed was occasionally empty, the widget would result in 500 errors. [RP #1535](https://github.com/INN/largo/pulls/1535) for [issue #1511](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1511) and [#893](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/893).
- Removes lingering traces of the Largo Featured Widget. [PR #1563](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1563) and [#1469](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1469) for [issue #1467](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1467), from Github user [mikeschinkel](https://github.com/mikeschinkel).
- Removes many uses of `extract()` in widgets and theme functions, and improves code quality in widgets.
- Removes uses of `screen_icon()` and `get_screen_icon()`, deprecated in WordPress 4.8. [PR #1523](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1531) for [issue #1523](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1523) as part of [issue #844](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/844).
- Removes the `<title>` element from `header.php`, since Largo declares `title-tag` theme support. [PR #1566](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1566) for [issue #1470](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1470).
- Removes two remaining PHP short tags. [PR #1525](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1525) for [issue #844](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/844).
- Removes some deprecated `style.css` metadata tags. [PR #1524](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1524) for [issue #844](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/844).
- Removes Hipchat support from `.travis.yml`. [PR #1503](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1503).

### Upgrade notices
- If your child theme has significant custom styling, or has custom post templates, your theme may need to provide additional styles to ensure Gutenberg compatibility.
- A future version of Largo will require the third parameter of `largo_byline()` to be specified in all calls. [PR #1561](https://github.com/INN/largo/pull/1561) for [issue #1517](https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1517) adds code that, in testing environments with `WP_DEBUG` or `LARGO_DEBUG` set to `true`, will result in server log messages. This is necessary to prevent mismatches between the Loop's global `$post` and the desired byline output. The third parameter of `largo_byline()` may be a `WP_Post` instance or a post ID. Example call: `largo_byline( true, false, get_the_ID() );`.

- A number of changes to the Largo Related Posts widget, including removing the option for placing the image before or after the headline and making the “Show byline” checkbox work (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1243 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1242)
- A revised Largo Taxonomy List widget, including the ability to exclude terms, limiting output of related terms to 5 or fewer, making the “taxonomy” chooser into a `<select>` box, and adding the ability to sort alphabetically by term name or by newest term first (to fix a performance issue where it was outputting infinite terms) (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1187)
- Supports a “None” option for top term, allowing posts to have no top term set (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1090 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1082, https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1094)
- Posts that have been updated now display the updated date/time at the top of the post. This creates a new function `largo_edited_date()` which displays either the time since updated or the date of update. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1343 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1341)
- Adds the Largo `post-type` taxonomy to the list of taxomomies that can be chosen for a post’s Top Term. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1086 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1084)

### Developer Notes / Potentially Breaking Changes
- Adds WordPress master, 4.6, 4.5, 4.3, and 4.3 to our Travis config and removes support for WordPress 3.9 and 4.0, while simplifying the Travis config. Thanks to @ntwb for his help here!  (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1116 and https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1227 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1020)
- Fixes a bunch of tests that were broken by PHP 5.5 (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1293 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1209)
- The minimum supported PHP version is now officially 5.3. This was already the case, because Largo uses anonymous functions, a feature introduced in PHP 5.3, but it was not documented until this release. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1345 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1344)
- Improved support for WordPress 4.5 and following (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1239 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1238 and https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1225 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1224)
- **Formally deprecates** the constant `SHOW_STICKY_NAV`, which had been kept around since `0.5.4`. `0.5.4` had effectively deprecated it, but we didn’t make a note of that in the release notes and some sites were affected. https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1136 contained a backwards compatability fix for the `master` branch of Largo between `0.5.4` and `0.5.5`. See PR https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1136 and Issue https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1135
- Adds a counter to `archive.php` and `category.php` to allow running a new action `largo_loop_after_post_x` after every post, passing the counter and the context. This is useful if you want to output a widget area after the `n`th post. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1272)
  `largo_byline()` has been broken up into a number of classes and wrapper function, to make it easier to maintain. Child-theme replacements of `largo_byline()` as a [pluggable function](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions) are not affected. Filtering functions hooked on the filter `largo_byline` are not affected. ([#1251](https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1251) and https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1265 for [#1126](https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1126), https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1312, https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1367, https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1343, https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1333)
  `largo_top_term()` now outputs `’’` empty strings if a post does not have a top term, which is saved as `‘none’` in the `’top_term’` post meta. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1090 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1082, https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1094)
- Cleans up the Largo Follow Widget to no longer require Twitter javascript (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1115)
- Updates the markup used for the Facebook page widget (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1115)
- Uses `rect_thumb` image size instead of `full` in `partials/content.php` (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1125)
- Adds the top term to the post classes if it is set, in the form `top-term-{$taxonomy_slug}-{$term_slug}` (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1132 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1119)
  `largo_remove_hero()` is now run on the two-column `’classic’` post template. This can be disabled with the filter `largo_remove_hero` to allow this to be disabled categorically or on a per-post basis. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1140 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/934)
  `.hero` styles are no longer grouped under the `body.normal` selector (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1140 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/934)
- Updates TGMPA to the latest version and updates the list of recommended plugins (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1151)
- Site-wide footers on Series Landing Page now use the correct `$post` (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1176)
- Removes final references to Argo Links, replacing all references and recommendations with Link Roundups (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1203 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/926)
- Breaks up `inc/post-tags.php`, making that file smaller and putting some other functions in places that make more sense for them. This creates the new files `inc/pagination.php` and `inc/post-social.php` (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1250)
  `partials/content-series.php` has been merged into `partials/content.php`, introducing new filter `largo_content_partial_arguments` to change the display of that and adding the new function `largo_content_partial_arguments_filter()` to affect how `partials/content.php` displays in certain contexts. This also removes rendering of YouTube videos in `partials/content.php` (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1280 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1271 and https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1326)
- **Removes** the files for the deprecated Largo Sidebar Featured Posts, Largo Footer Featured Posts, and  \* Largo Featured Posts widgets (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1294 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/897)
- Adds new function `largo_maybe_top_term()` which outputs `largo_top_term()` wrapped in an `h5.top-tag` if and only if `largo_top_term()` would return a link. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1319, https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1318 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1316 and https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1317)
  ### New Actions and Filters
- Adds new filter `largo_additional_networks` to allow child themes to add additional social networks. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1115) 
- Applies `largo_get_partial_by_post_type` to support per-type custom partials in category and archive pages (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1122, https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1258)
- Adds action hooks in the main navigation: (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1101)
  `largo_before_main_nav_shelf`
  `largo_before_main_nav_list_items`
  `largo_after_main_nav_list_items`
  `largo_after_main_nav_shelf`
- Adds actions in `partials/largo-header.php` before and after `largo_header()`: (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1114)
  `largo_header_before_largo_header`
  `largo_header_after_largo_header`
- Adds new filter `largo_archive_rounduplink_title` to allow Link Roundups to change the archive title (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1127 for https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues/1123)
- The social links that are output in `largo_post_social_links` can now be edited using array functions using the `largo_post_social_more_social_links` filter (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1128)
- Adds new action at the bottom of the one- and two-column single post templates called `largo_post_bottom_widget_area` The Article Bottom widget area is now hooked on this action as the function `largo_post_bottom_widget_area()`. (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1131)
- Adds filter `largo_top_term_metabox_taxonomies` to allow changing which taxonomies terms may be drawn from for use as top terms (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1200)
- Adds new action `largo_after_category_river` to match `largo_before_category_river`, adds `largo_category_acter_description_in_header` which runs in the header before `get_template_part('partials/archive', 'category-related');` (https://github.com/INN/Largo/pull/1217)

### Developer-facing changes
